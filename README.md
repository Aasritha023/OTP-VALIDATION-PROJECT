Here’s a README.md file content for your OTP validation project:

OTP Validation Using Python & SMTP
This project implements an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system using Python's smtplib to send OTPs via email. Users receive a randomly generated OTP and must enter it correctly to verify their identity.

📌 Features
✅ Generate a 4-digit random OTP

✅ Send OTP via Gmail SMTP

✅ Secure connection using TLS (port 587)

✅ User verification through OTP input

⚙️ Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended) and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install secure-smtplib
Enable SMTP for Gmail
Before running the script, ensure:

You have a Gmail account.

You enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account.

You generate an App Password (instead of using your Gmail password).

⚠️ Troubleshooting
🛑 "SMTPAuthenticationError"
Double-check your email & password.

Ensure you are using a Gmail App Password, not your actual password.

🛑 "TimeoutError: [WinError 10060]"
Your network might be blocking SMTP. Try using a different network or check your firewall settings.

🛑 "smtplib.SMTPServerDisconnected"
Make sure Less Secure Apps is enabled (for personal Gmail accounts).
